For the first time in minutes her Mom spoke, "Are you...?"

Carly looked up at me apologetically. We'd decided today wasn't the right time to tell them and I don't really think she meant to. I think she was speaking broadly and hypothetically but she also lacked any kind of subterfuge when her Mom asked. I nodded slightly towards her parents and she looked back at them. Her father's eyes were snapping back and forth between us, trying to kill me with a glance. But her mother was beaming as Carly nodded and said, "Yes... About six weeks along."

I instinctively held my hand over Carly's belly and gave her a little peck. "Oh, that's wonderful. That's so wonderful!" her mother said. "Isn't that wonderful, dear?"

"You come into my house and ask for my blessing and then tell me you've already... " he said as he stood, angry and fists balled.

I stood up too but forced my voice to stay calm, "It was never our intention, Mr. Young. We used protection and were responsible but sometimes that doesn't work."

"Responsible would have been to keep your lily white hands off of my daughter," he snarled in rage. I felt certain that this was going to come to blows and the only question running through my head was how much was I going to defend myself.

"Daddy!" Carly yelled at him.

"You stay out of this. Haven't you disappointed me enough for the day?" he said. The words shattered Carly who dropped back to the couch, sobbing.

"Mr. Young, I've tried to be nice to you but if you say another thing like that to your daughter, I don't know what I'll do." He looked down at his daughter and I could almost see the moment where the regret hit him. "You just told your daughter that she's disappointed you by giving you a grandchild. Is that really what you meant? Do you already hate your grandchild simply because he's half white?"

"No... of course not... No, Carly, I'm so sorry. I was angry and..." his wife cut him off gently and took Carly's hand. She led her daughter out of the room, leaving me and the deflated Asian man standing alone. "Jay. I'm sorry. Sit down. And stop calling me Mr. Young. Call me Chen."

"Okay, Chen. I'd like that. Can we start over?" I asked, trying to repair the bridge that nearly crumbled under our feet.

"Yes. Do you play chess?" he asked, gesturing at a table. Next to it was another table that caught my eye, however.

I smiled, "Rather than me beating you at Chess, why don't you show me who's boss in Go. I've always wanted to get better."

He smiled and laughed, "I'm not conceding you'd have won at Chess but sure. Let me show my new Caucasian friend the greatest game in the world. A Chinese game, mind you." He shook his finger at me in defiant gesture.

We sat down and started playing. I knew the basics of the game and had even played it online for awhile but two things hampered me. I'd never been very good and I hadn't played in several years. But Carly's dad was being very gracious as he stomped me.

"Why do you dislike me, Chen?"

"I don't. In fact, I quite like you. But you're not right for my daughter," he said simply. I placed another piece on the board as he pondered his move.

"Why is that?"

"She needs to feel a part of her community. To not be sucked into a whole new world," the white stone he placed cut me off and built a solid corner for him. I looked elsewhere for opportunities that already felt very scant.

"I won't ever take that from her. Her family and friends are very important. And I know it's important to you too. I even setup Sherry with a young man from my office. You'll like him. He's very respectful."

He eyed me, "You are the one that setup Sherry and Hideo?"

I nodded, keeping all the other sordid details to myself. "I am. Look, I'm not some kid with... well... yellow fever. That's not me. In fact, I've never dated an Asian girl before. When I came down here, it wasn't for Carly even. I was hung up on her friend Kyrsten."

"Oh yes... Kyrsten. She was such a lovely girl. I hate that her family went through all of that. So what happened? How'd you end up... dating... my daughter?" There was still an edge to his voice. I could tell he still wasn't happy with the situation but learning more about me was helping.

"Kyrsten came down here with her own intentions on someone and it wasn't me. Carly and I were kind of the odd ones out at the park that day and got to talking. She and I have a lot in common, you know."

"Such as?" he asked.

"We're both very smart. We were #2 and #3 in our graduating class. We're both geeks. We both moved far too far North for our liking or our parents liking."

He snorted at that, confirming what I suspected. He missed his daughters. "She and I are very compatible in virtually every way. And Mr. Young... Chen... Her biggest concern from the moment we started... dating... was about you. About what you'd think. She wanted to tell you but didn't want to do it over the phone."

He nodded and placed another stone, capturing three of mine. "I appreciate that. I also appreciate that you stood up to me. Not many people do that these days. And what I said needed to be called out. I'm going to have to grovel to my wife for forgiveness later."

"I doubt your wife wants you to grovel, Chen."

"What makes you say that?"

I considered, "The way she looks at you. In admiration. I think she's very grateful to have a man that has been strong enough to protect her and build all of this."

He looked around and nodded. "It's not been easy. My father was a hard man but very traditional. He was one of the people who most opposed the elimination of polygamy."

"I didn't know that was a thing there?"

"Typical westerner. Thought your Mormons had a monopoly on that?" he said but it was mostly good natured teasing. Besides, he was right.

I shrugged, "I suspect everyone thinks there country is the center of the world. How much do either of us know about Nigerian history, right?"

He looked at me and paused before returning to the game. He placed another devastating white stone that crippled any hope of a recovery. "Very astute, Jay. I see what Carly sees in you. But he had to grow up with years of colonialism then the Japanese occupation then the destruction of what was left of the old ways by the Communists. His biggest complaint was that the spine had been bred out of Chinese men. Mao was the one lucky man with a spine in a country that had lost any strength of character."

"Too bad Mao was such a monster."

"The ones strong enough to lead always are," he said.

"You're not," I told him, trying to reassure him.

He laughed in response, "You think I'm talking about me? Hah. I'm not a leader. I have simply done what I had to for my family. I'm talking about you and your ilk. Just look at the President. He would never have wanted me here and I built a Fortune 5000 company from nothing. Hell, I'm one of the military's biggest suppliers outside of Lockheed and Boeing."

I nodded, "Sounds like a leader to me."

"My wife doesn't think so," he said as he looked into the kitchen where the two women seemed to be talking quietly. "She wants me to be strong but I'm not."

"You're in here standing up for your daughter and what you think is right. What more could she want?"

"She thinks that I should either be strong enough to kick you out or secure enough in my convictions to let Carly go. She doesn't like... this..." he said as he gestured between us. "Though she seems pretty happy about the grandchild. I guess you knew the way to her heart!"

"Call her in here," I said simply. He looked at me and I nodded reassuringly.

"Liang!" he called, "You and Carly can come back. We've calmed things down."

The two women looked at each other and shrugged then walked back into the room. "Chen and I have worked things out. And I think he and I have reached an... accord? Maybe an armistice is most appropriate."

Carly's dad nodded in agreement beside me. "But it's important to me that the family is unified around this. Are you in agreement, Liang?" I asked.

She looked at me then at her husband before nodding.

"Excellent, then I can do this right," I said as I dropped to my knee and fished into my pocket. "Carly. Will you marry me?" I asked.

Carly's reaction was everything a man could hope for. She fell down to her knees in tears, hugging and kissing me, "Of course. Yes, Jay. Of course. I love you. Yes, yes, yes!" she said in between kisses. I gave her a firm kiss then guided her back to my seat. I looked back at Carly's parents. Her father still looked a little displeased and uneasy but not hostile. His wife was grinning proudly.

"Liang, come here," I said. She looked startled to be addressed that way but walked a couple steps towards me nevertheless. "Your husband says that you don't think he's strong enough?" She started to turn to look at him as words formed on her lips, "Look at me," I said simply and she complied. Like mother like daughter.

"Sometimes... I uhmm... wish he was a little stronger. Yes."

"Carly needs the same thing in a man. But since your husband can't provide that, I'll be taking over this family. You'll both serve me from now on. Would you like that?" She nodded emphatically, "Consider it the new order of things. Carly is mine, and so are you, Liang."

"Uhmm... I.. uhmm... I don't know if... I mean... "

"What is it Liang?" I asked her as she floundered for words.

"It's just. I mean... no offense, dear," she said vaguely over her shoulder. "I don't know if he can accept this."

"Oh... is that so?" She swallowed hard as I moved closer. I saw her husband tense behind her but he made no other movement. "And how do you know how... strong, I am?"

She blushed very cutely before whispering, "Carly was... telling me..."

"And what did she tell you?"

She bit her lip and looked at me, "About what she calls you and why she calls you it?"

"What does she call him? What are you talking about?" Chen said finally.

"Tell him, Carly," I said.

Carly looked at me then back at her father, "Ar... Are you sure?"

I turned to her and simply asked, "Do you trust me?"

She nodded without any hesitation. All reservations and anxiety left her and she simply answered, "Of course, Master. In everything."

"Master? Carly! What the hell are you saying?"

"Chen, I think you are the exception that proves the rule. I normally hate that phrase because it's so over used but I think this is a perfect use of it. You hate that the world sees Asian men as submissive. That your father watched an entire generation bow down to one man. And you've fought so hard not to be like those spineless people who allowed Communism to take root."

He nodded but said nothing. I placed my hand on Liang's shoulder and turned her towards her husband so they could see each other.

"But you aren't strong. Not strong enough for this woman you've been married to for all these years. You can sense her disappointment in you, can't you. You're not strong enough to please her," I said and I lowered my lips to her exposed neck, "And you're not strong enough to stop me from taking her," I said as I ran my finger down the neckline of her shirt and traced her breasts, teasing the nipples through the fabric.

"I'm not..." he started but his complete lack of movement told me I had been right.

"Let's ask the impartial party in the room. The one who loves all three of us. Carly, you know your Mom better than anything. What does she want right this instant."

Carly made a show of studying her mother. My fingers continued to tease her, stroking her gently. All she managed was a whimpered, "Please..." directed at the room in general.

"She wants you to fuck her, Master," she said and her mother whimpered.

"And your father? What does he want?"

"He wants his wife to be happy. But he can't give her that, so he'll have to watch as you take her," she said.

"And what do you want?"

She smiled at me, "I want whatever you want, Master. That's what my race has been bred for. To please white men. Our bodies respond to you because we've been bred that way, Master."

"Is she saying anything incorrect, Liang?"

"Nnn... Nooo," she said as my finger traced inside her dress to stroke her hard nipple more directly. She gasped.

"How do you address a white man who is about to fuck you in front of your husband?"

"Mm... Master," she said with a gasp.

"That's right. I'm going to fuck you right here. You know, we're pretty sure I knocked up your slut daughter with one of my first loads. If you're lucky, maybe I'll give her a sister today."

"Now wait a minute..." Chen started but before he could say anything, I cut him off.

"Shut up, Chen. You'll watch and learn your place," I said sternly. He fell silent, his face a mix of shock and resignation.

"That's right. Now bend over and pull your dress up. I'm going to take what's mine now."

She dutifully pulled her skirt up then bent over the back of the couch. I gave her ass a slap and watched it jiggle. She obviously kept herself in good shape. Then I slid two fingers into her cunt. She was definitely ready for what I was about to give her. I fished my cock out and slammed it home. The scream of sheer ecstasy from Carly's mother was practically musical. I grabbed her hips and started ramming her without preamble and without mercy. "See Chen. With sluts like these, you have to just take what you want from them."

"Fuck yes... fuck yes, Master. Fuckfuckfuck," Liang said as I continued to pound her. Hearing the prim and proper mother of my favorite slut swear like a sailor was pretty hot.

"You'll never touch her again, Chen. She's mine now. You'll grovel at her feet while I use her as my sex slave," I growled, my voice filled with dominance.

"Yes, Master! I'm yours! Use me!" Liang moaned louder, her body trembling with pleasure.

I smacked her ass three times hard, "That's right, you dumb chink whore," I growled into her ear. "You're nothing but a hole for my cock now."

"Yes, Master," she whimpered as I continued to ram into her.

"Oh, and Chen, that nice boy that is dating Sherry? He's probably never going to fuck her and I'll be breeding her when she graduates just like your other slut daughter and your wife. Understand."

Chen's eyes went wide, but he nodded, saying nothing.

"Glad that's settled, now cum for me you dumb cunt. Make that pathetic loose twat nice and tight so I can fill your hole with my cum."

"Yes, Master," she said as she squeezed herself tight around me. Truthfully, she had already been pretty tight but now she was squeezing me like a vice and it felt amazing. Finally, after rutting my future mother-in-law's tight cunt for a solid twenty minutes, I felt my orgasm coming. I yanked her hair roughly and spun her around, shoving her to the floor.

She was so lost in the moment, all thoughts of safety and protection were gone and she screamed, "Nooo!" at the sudden emptiness.

"Shut up and take my cum, whore!" I told the kneeling woman as I stroked the first rope out of my cock.

"Yes, Master. Cover my filthy fucking face with your white seed!" she screamed and I emptied all over her face, hair and neck. As I pumped the last bits onto her, she rubbed herself to an orgasm, shaking as she nuzzled my cock, soaking up the last remnants with her hair.

When I pulled away, an almost obscene amount of cum was covering, probably ruined, blouse as well as dripping from her face onto the tiled floor. I simply shoved her forward, spent, over the back of the couch as I went to Carly. I didn't even have to tell her what to do. She gave me a passionate, loving kiss then dropped to her knees to slurp off the mess that our juices had made around my cock. As she did, I talked to her dad. "So it's settled then Chen?"

"Uhmm... uh... yes," he was staring at his wife with a mix of horror, lust and, yes, defeat.

"Now you know your place, Chen. You'll serve your wife while I use her. You'll grovel and beg for her attention, but she'll always belong to me."

"I... understand... Master," he said, his voice trembling.

I pulled him a little closer and whispered in his ear, "You'll watch every time I fuck her. You'll clean her up afterwards. And if you're lucky, I might let you touch her once in a while."

He nodded, his face flushed with humiliation.

As Carly and I left, she leaned into me, "You are such a dominant fucking stud. I love you. Thank you for taking over my family. How do you do it?"

I looked at her and gave her a kiss, "I've already got a bunch of sluts throwing themselves at me. Like I fucking needed one more," I said with a smirk. She punched me but laughed, knowing that I was just teasing. Truthfully, I was glad that I could assert my dominance over her family and add another slut to my growing harem.
